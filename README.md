# Plant_leave_recognizer-AMD_project
> Luca Merlini
***
### General characteristics
  - Supervised learning problem
  - Multiclass classification
  - The goal is to find the best predictive model to distinguish leaves images in the correct 12 classes
***
The project is divided into ten main parts.
### 1 - Libraries and data loading
  - Import of useful libraries
  - Data loading through Kaggle API
### 2 - Data exploration and organization
  - Data exploration
  - Data organization
### 3 - Scalable environment
  - Creation of distributed and scalable environment
### 4 - Data preprocessing
  - Data preprocessing and recaling 
### 5 - CNN basic
  - Creation of a first convolutional neural network
### 6 - CNN with dropout
  - Creation of a new model with more convolutional layers and adding dropout to reduce overfitting
### 7 - CNN with dropout and data augmentation
  - Creation of a new model with more convolutional layers mixing dropout and data augmentation 
### 8 - Hyperparameter tuning
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the parameters of the previous section
### 9 - CNN with transfer learning
  - Resnet50
  - DenseNet121
### 10 - Predictions on test set
  - Evaluation and predictions on unseen data
